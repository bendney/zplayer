3. Operation
------------

OpenMCU-ru listens on H.323 and SIP ports for incoming connections.

On incoming connection server creates room, specified by remote
terminal and connects client to this room. If client did not specify
any room then client will be connected to default room
("room101" by default, can be changed in options).

You can call to the server using the destination address:
"room_name@hostname_or_ip_address".

New rooms are created automatically when they are accessed.
Also, there is default room for clients which did not specify room
or which are unable to specify it (for example NetMeeting).

During the conference you will hear other members and will see them
in the video window. You can setup voice activation detection (VAD),
change screen layout and configure other parameters via the web interface.
